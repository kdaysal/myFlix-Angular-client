This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.1.0.

## Main Objective

The purpose of this project was to use Angular to build out the client-side of an application called MyFlix, based on its existing server-side code (REST API and database) along with supporting documentation.

## User Stories

* As a user, I want to be able to receive information on movies, directors, and genres so that I
can learn more about movies Iâ€™ve watched or am interested in.

* As a user, I want to be able to create a profile so I can save data about my favorite movies

## Key Features

* The app displays a welcome view where users can either login or register a new account

</p>

* Once authenticated, the user can now view all movies

* Each movie card contains links to open dialogues with additional information about the movie's director, genre, and synopsis

## Technical Requirements

* The application must be written in Angular (version 9 or later)

* The application requires the latest version of Node.js and npm package

* The application must contain user registration and login forms

* The application must be designed using Angular Material

* The application's codebase must contain comments using Typedoc

* The project must contain technical documentation using JSDoc

* The project must be hosted on GitHub Pages

## Technologies / strategies used in this project

* [Trello](https://trello.com/en) - kanban board for working through this project following Agile principles

* [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) - framework chosen for this version of the myFlix app

* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)

* [Angular Material Design](https://material.angularjs.org/latest/) - reusable, well-tested and accessible UI components for Angular JS apps

* [TypeDoc](https://typedoc.org/) - converts comments in TypeScript source code into rendered HTML documentation

* [JSDoc](https://github.com/jsdoc/jsdoc) - an API documentation generator for JavaScript

* JavaScript, HTML, SCSS

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
